# Product Prioritization Dashboard
## Overview
This project implements the RICE framework (Reach, Impact, Confidence, Effort) to help product managers prioritize features effectively.  
It calculates RICE scores, sorts features by priority, and visualizes them in a bar chart dashboard.  
## Features
- Define a product backlog with features and parameters.  
- Automatically compute RICE scores for each feature.  
- Generate a ranked backlog table (highest priority first).  
- Visualize priorities with a clean bar chart.  
## Tools Used
- Python  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib  
- Google Colab  
## How to Run
1. Open the provided `.ipynb` notebook in Google Colab.  
2. Run all cells to compute RICE scores and generate outputs.  
3. View the ranked backlog table in the console.  
4. See a bar chart dashboard of feature priorities.  
## Example Output
- Ranked backlog sorted by RICE score.  
- Horizontal bar chart showing priority distribution.  
## Applications
- Backlog grooming  
- Sprint planning  
- Product roadmap discussions  
- Data-driven feature prioritization
